Let's fight bad code with more bad code.

## Premise
Anyone that knows how AI works knows that it will never be as good at programming as we are.
That's why I am so frustrated having to deal with terrible AI generated code.
The plan here is to (try to) fight fire with fire, to hopefully sort out some issues before they arise.
