# Vibekiller
Let's fight bad code with more bad code.

## Premise
Anyone that knows how AI works knows that it will never be as good at programming as we are.
That's why I am so frustrated having to deal with terrible AI generated code.
I love my friends, but they are not programmers, and their placeholder AI code keeps breaking my code!
The plan here is to (try to) fight fire with fire, to hopefully sort out some issues before they arise.

## Usage

 - Download the application from the [Releases](https://github.com/Ceebox/Vibekiller/releases) section.
	 - If desired, configure the model to be used in the `appsettings.json`.
	 - Please note that gated models require `ModelApiToken` to be populated with your API token.
 - Switch your repository to the branch that you want to be reviewed. 
 - Execute the `vibekiller` command in your command line from that repository.
	 - Generally, you'll want to execute something like `vibekiller review --target main`. 

## Contributing
This is just an idea. Please don't. ;)
